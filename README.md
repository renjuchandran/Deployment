Each Salesperson will be assigned with a target(no of products to be sold) for each months. Which is given to them based on their last month achievement(no of products sold) i.e, 10% increased from the last achievement.

To  predict  the target given to each salesperson for the next month based on their previous  achievement  instead   of
giving  them simply 10% hike. Applied XGBoost Regressor to predict the sales of each salesperson.The model deployed on Flask.
